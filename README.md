## Built With

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) - As a programming language.

* [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

* [Room DB](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) - Room is an ORM, Object Relational Mapping library. In other words, Room will map our database objects to Java objects. Room provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. 

* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - For multithreading while handling requests to the server and local database.

* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) - To handle app navigation.


* [Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM)](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) - Offers an implementation of observer design pattern.

* [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value. For example, you can use a flow to receive live updates from a database.


* [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - It is arguably the most used Dependency Injection, or DI, framework for Android. Many Android projects use Dagger to simplify building and providing dependencies across the app. It gives you the ability to create specific scopes, modules, and components, where each forms a piece of a puzzle: The dependency graph.

* [Clean Architecture](https://www.raywenderlich.com/3595916-clean-architecture-tutorial-for-android-getting-started) - Applying Clean Architecture and Solid Principles to build a robust, maintainable, and testable application.


# Note:
 > I maked this app to just for working on RoomDB, MVVM with Clean Architecture.
   and practice with jetpack compose.
